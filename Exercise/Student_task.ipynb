Oh, nevermind) has reached out to you and asked for a report on your observations from your experiment, for reasons they'd rather not disclose apparently. They seem particularly interested in how changing various parameters might affect the process. Go ahead and play around with your algorithm a bit (perhaps you'd like to try out different population sizes or tweak your fitness function?) to generate an answer for them. Turns out your lab has an email template you can use, so all you'll need to do is plug in your observations and hope they're not used for anything...potentially problematic.\n",
